He represents millions like him who, throughout our history, have put the lives of others above their own and will be doing so today. \\n\\\"For me, this is a source of enduring hope in difficult and unpredictable times.\\\"\\nThis year's message was recorded in mid-December with a pared-back film crew and in accordance with government guidance.\\nShe did not utter the words \\\"pandemic\\\", \\\"coronavirus\\\" or \\\"Covid-19\\\" but they were the dominant theme of this year's Christmas speech broadcast by the Queen.\\nHer words conveyed three particular messages. She spoke of the gratitude owed to all those who'd \\\"risen magnificently to the challenges of the year\\\", in particular to young people, frontline workers and the \\\"amazing achievements of modern science.\\\"\\nShe found hope in the actions of so many \\\"Good Samaritans\\\" who'd emerged across society to offer care.\\nThere was hope too from the example of the \\\"Unknown Warrior\\\" buried at Westminster Abbey a century ago. He symbolised selfless duty: a source of \\\"enduring hope\\\" the Queen said.\\nAnd finally there was reassurance for all those who are mourning or missing friends or family. This was the most touching part of the broadcast. These were people who just wanted \\\"a hug or a squeeze of the hand\\\" the Queen said.\\nThat is not language she often uses in public.\\nShe added: \\\"Let the light of Christmas, the spirit of selflessness, love and above all, hope, guide us in the times ahead.\\\"\\nThe Queen and Prince Philip, 99, have been living at Windsor Castle during the pandemic with a small household staff.\\nIt is thought to be the first year the couple have not spent Christmas at their Sandringham home since the mid-1980s.\\nThe Royal Family usually spends Christmas Day together, but will not visit each other this year because of coronavirus restrictions.\\nThe Queen also worshipped privately rather than attending a church service, as she usually does - in order, it is understood, to avoid crowds of well-wishers congregating.\\nOn Christmas Day, the Royal Family tweeted a video of St George's Chapel choir singing.\\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge acknowledged those going through a particularly difficult time this year because of the pandemic, tweeting pictures of people working through the festive season.\\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall sent their Christmas wishes on social media, telling followers, \\\"Here's to a better new year.\\\"\\nThe Queen's address marks the end of a year that saw her go for seven months - March to October - without carrying out public engagements outside of a royal residence.\\nDuring that time, her eldest child, Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirus and displayed mild symptoms.\\nPalace sources also told the BBC that the Prince William tested positive in April - though Kensington Palace refused to comment officially.\\nThe royals have spent some time together during the pandemic.\\nThe Queen and several other senior royals attended a socially-distanced Christmas carol concert at Windsor Castle this month.\\nShe was also joined by family members at a scaled-back Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall in November.\\nThe Christmas broadcast was the Queen's third televised address this year, which is unusual for the monarch. \\nIn April, as the first wave of the pandemic saw people across the country told to stay at home, she vowed that the the UK \\\"will succeed\\\" in its fight against the virus.\\nIn a rallying message, she lamented the \\\"painful sense of separation from their loved ones\\\" that social distancing was causing people - but said it was \\\"the right thing to do\\\".\\nThe following month, in a poignant address to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, she said people's response to the virus had filled empty streets with \\\"love\\\".\\nIn last year's Christmas speech, she described 2019 - which saw intense political debate over Brexit and a number of personal events affecting the Royal Family - as \\\"quite bumpy\\\".\\nShe said the path is never \\\"smooth\\\" but \\\"small steps\\\" can heal divisions.\\nChannel 4's alternative Christmas message will be delivered by a deepfake of the Queen this year.\\n\"\n",
